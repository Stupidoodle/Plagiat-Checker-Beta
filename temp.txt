The chain was founded in February 1902, as Franklin Simon Specialty
Shops by Franklin Simon (1865-1934) and his business partner Herman A.
Flurscheim. Leroy C. Palmer became president of the company in 1934 at
the death of Franklin Simon, and Benjamin Goldstein was the head of
Franklin Simon until 1963. The store's concept was "to import much of
his merchandise [from Europe] with a view to selling the imported goods
as cheaply, if possible, as the domestic."

In 1936, the chain was purchased by Atlas Corporation from the Simon
family for $2 million. In 1945, Franklin Simon & Co. was acquired by
City Stores Company of Philadelphia. Oppenheim Collins & Company, Inc
merged with Franklin Simon, but the two chains continued to operate
under separate trade names and as separate divisions under the newly
formed City Specialty Stores. In 1961/1962, City Stores changed the name
of the Oppenheim Collins & Co. stores to Franklin Simon. City Stores
filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy in July 1979. Under the reorganization
plan, City Stores closed the 42 Franklin Simon stores.

In 1993, Dover Books on Costume reissued the "Franklin Simon Fashion
Catalog for 1923".
